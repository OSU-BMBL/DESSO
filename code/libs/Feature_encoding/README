    Feature_encoding.pl input_file

DESCRIPTION
    Feature_encoding.pl is a perl script that performs feature encoding on the input file. 
    The input file needs to have extension '.txt.s' and contains content in the following format:

    <Measure 1> <Sequence 1>
    <Measure 2> <Sequence 2>
    ......
    <Measure N> <Sequence N>

    Here is one example: (extracted from the file "sample_input.txt.s" in the folder "Sample_input")

    8.0578  TTGTCAATTATATGCTAAG
    7.8521  GCTGAGGTTACACTTGACT
    ......
    7.7909  TGCAGAGTTACGACATTAG

    For a given input file, the following feature combinations will be generated:
    #Feature combination  -->  #File label
    1mer --> 1mer
    1mer+2mer --> 1a2mer
    1mer+2mer+3mer --> 1a2a3mer
    1mer+shape --> 1mer4shape
    shape --> 4shape
    1mer+MGW --> 1merM
    1mer+Roll --> 1merR
    1mer+HelT --> 1merT
    1mer_ProT --> 1merP
    1mer+MGW+Roll --> 1merMR
    1mer+Roll+ProT --> 1merRP
    1mer+2mer+shape -->1a2mer4shape

    For each feature combination the following three files will be generated:
    1. '.libsvm' -- feature combinations in libsvm format
    2. '.matlab' -- feature combinations in matlab format 
    3. '.label' -- The labels of all the features

    Also, you can fine-tune the behavior of the feature encoding by setting the options 
    listed between line 35 and 45 of the script 'Feature_encoding.pl'.
